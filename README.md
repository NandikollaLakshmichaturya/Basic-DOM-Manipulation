# Basic-DOM-Manipulation
This project is a simple Counter App built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It demonstrates basic DOM manipulation by allowing users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter. Event listeners update the display dynamically, ensuring the count never goes below zero, with a clean and minimal UI design.
